Welcome to my plot of the internet.  This site is mostly oriented towards topics
related to software development, but you might find some things that are
completely unrelated as well.  The “source code” for the site (if you can call
markdown and a basic build system source code) [are available through git][1].

Now go branch off to a subsection of the site:

  - [My Projects][2]
  - [Other Websites][6]

  - [Interesting Papers][3]
