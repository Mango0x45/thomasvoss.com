DIFFING:
  Since this site uses lowdown(1) for markdown to html conversions, and diffing
  markdown with diff(1) is kinda shit, you can configure git with the following
  commands to use lowdown-diff(1) for diffing markdown:

    $ printf '[diff "md-diff"]\n\tcommand = ./ld-diff' >> .git/config


STRUCTURE:
  The file structure is as follows:

    .
    └── src
        ├── XX                # Pages in the XX language (such as de, en, etc.)
        │   ├── dirname
        │   │   └── index.md  # The page located at <URL>/XX/dirname
        │   ├── head.html     # The header of every generated page
        │   ├── style.scss    # Language-specific styles (such as “” vs „“)
        │   └── tail.html     # The tail of every generated page
        └── style.scss        # Global stylesheet


BUILDING:
  You can build the site by simply running “make”; the compiled output will be
  in the “out/” directory.  You can also run “make clean” to remove it.  In
  order to build the site you should have lowdown(1) installed to convert MD to
  HTML, and sassc(1) to convert SCSS to CSS.  These are both in the Artix repos
  as “lowdown” and “sassc” but I would imagine they are in the Arch repos too,
  and probably other distributions of Linux.  If you’re on the BSDs you’re smart
  enough to build them from source if they aren’t packaged, and if you’re on
  W*ndows or something... lol.


MARKDOWN STYLE GUIDE:
  For improved readability, sentences should be double spaces:

    Hello world!  How are you doing today?  # Good
    Hello world! How are you doing today?   # Bad

  Proper unicode characters should be used where appropriate.  This includes
  characters such as quotation marks (“”), the Dutch “IJ” if writing in Dutch
  (Ĳ, ĳ), and the ellipsis (…).  Some of these characters may look odd in a
  monospace font, but when compiled to HTML it ensures the proper characters are
  used:

    So he said: “I have a bad feeling about this…”    # Good
    So he said: "I have a bad feeling about this..."  # Bad

  If german pages are ever added to the site, the capital eszett (‘ẞ’) should be
  used when appropriate as opposed to “SS”:

    DIE STRAẞEN   # Good
    DIE STRASSEN  # Bad

  Indents should be two spaces:

    # Good
    Here is a list:

      - Hello
      - World

    # Bad
    Here is a list:

     - Hello
     - World


SCSS/MAKEFILE STYLE GUIDE:
  Use 8 column tabs.
