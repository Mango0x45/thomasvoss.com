Since this site uses lowdown(1) for markdown to html conversions, and diffing
markdown with diff(1) is kinda shit, you can configure git with the following
commands to use lowdown-diff(1) for diffing markdown:

    $ printf '[diff "md-diff"]\n\tcommand = ./ld-diff' >> .git/config

The file structure is as follows:

    .
    └── src
        ├── XX                # Pages in the XX language (such as de, en, etc.)
        │   ├── dirname
        │   │   └── index.md  # The page located at <URL>/XX/dirname
        │   ├── head.html     # The header of every generated page
        │   ├── style.scss    # Language-specific styles (such as “” vs „“)
        │   └── tail.html     # The tail of every generated page
        └── style.scss        # Global stylesheet

You can build the site by simply running “make”; the compiled output will be in
the “out/” directory.  You can also run “make clean” to remove it.  In order to
build the site you should have lowdown(1) installed to convert MD to HTML, and
sassc(1) to convert SCSS to CSS.  These are both in the Artix repos as “lowdown”
and “sassc” but I would imagine they are in the Arch repos too, and probably
other distributions of Linux.  If you’re on the BSDs you’re smart enough to
build them from source if they aren’t packaged, and if you’re on W*ndows or
something... lol.
